# Initial Setup

1. Create the "Non Recurring" sheet, which hosts a table starting at cell A1.
  Add the headers "Date", "Description", "Amount", "Account". Add non-recurring
  transactions, chronologically organized.
2. Create the "Balances" sheet, which hosts the balances of all accounts, at
  the beginning and end of the period. Cell A1 should contain "Account", cell
  A2 should contain the date that the balance was held by the account, and cell
  A3 should contain some text (it only matters that it's not empty).
3. Run the script. The burndown table should be generated in the "Burndown
  Table" sheet.
